          p.my-4 You can easily access data as it was available in the native blockchain storage. We achieve this effect using a radically different way of putting data on-chain inspired by the meta-transactions pattern. 
          //We use a radically different way of putting data on-chain inspired by the meta-transactions pattern.
            | We append the raw transaction with an extra payload.
            | This data in automatically extracted by a proxy contract and put the content in on-chain storage.
            | After the transaction is executed we clear the storage to avoid gas payments

          p.my-4 The data which is temporarily put in storage could be used by all the protocols maintaining composability - the key aspect of DeFi. 
            | The solution is also very scalable as there is only a flat verification fee and no extra storage costs.

          p.my-4 The data could also be linked to your website, a mobile application or a backend server. 
            | We provide a classic http-api and a

            | to minimize the amount of code necessary for integration. 
          p.my-4 All data is delivered with a cryptographic signature allowing blockchain grade integrity in an off-chain environment.
